# Support-Vector-Machines-SVM-
Objective: Use SVMs for linear and non-linear classification. Tools: Scikit-learn, NumPy, Matplotlib. Guide: Load and prepare a dataset for binary classification. Train an SVM with linear and RBF kernel. Visualize decision boundary using 2D data. Tune hyperparameters like C and gamma. Use cross-validation to evaluate performance.
